1️⃣ What is the mid-price and why do we use it instead of last traded price?

2️⃣ If best bid = 100.00 and best ask = 100.20, what is the spread? Is this tight or wide for HFT?

3️⃣ Why must bids be sorted from highest to lowest, and asks from lowest to highest?

4️⃣ In one sentence: how does a market maker make money from the order book?


1️⃣ Mid-price is the average of best bid and best ask and represents the fair price.
2️⃣ A spread of 0.20 is wide and unfavorable for HFT.
3️⃣ Bids are sorted highest → lowest and asks lowest → highest to identify the top of the book (best prices).
4️⃣ A market maker earns by quoting both bid and ask and capturing the spread.
