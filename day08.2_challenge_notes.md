***DAY 8 – FINAL ANSWERS (COMPLETE)***

1️⃣ What is the bid–ask spread?
Bid is the highest price a buyer is willing to pay, ask is the lowest price a seller is willing to accept, and the bid–ask spread is the difference between ask and bid (ask − bid).

2️⃣ Why does liquidity matter for HFT?
High liquidity allows easy entry and exit of positions with tighter spreads and lower transaction costs, which is essential for HFT strategies.

3️⃣ Why are market orders bad for HFT?
Market orders are bad for HFT because they cause slippage and force execution at unfavorable prices, destroying small profit margins.

4️⃣ What is slippage?
Slippage is a hidden cost where an order executes at a different (worse) price than expected, for example placing a buy at 100 but getting filled at 100.05.

5️⃣ Why do HFT firms colocate servers near exchanges?
To receive prices and send orders milliseconds (or microseconds) faster than competitors, reducing latency and gaining execution priority.
